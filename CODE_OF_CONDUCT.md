# This is Just a Code Repo Code of Conduct

This is:

* A public repository to share code and track issues

This is NOT:

* Your priest
* Your parent
* Your moral guide
* Anything that has any authority over you whatsoever

As such, it pure silliness to issue a "code of conduct", but alas, GitHub really wants us to put them here. Conduct yourself however you see fit to conduct yourself, the same as you do in every other interaction in life.

If the very idea that a code repository can be considered "unsafe", then I strongly suggest you not interact with it. I don't even know what that means, nor do I wish to adopt the modern-era madness of pretending I do. I can assure you of one thing: in all of history, a code repository has never hurt anyone. I don't believe that this one will be an exception.
